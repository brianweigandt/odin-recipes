  <h1>Pork Knuckle/Shank or "Eisbein" or "Schweinshaxe"</h1>
  <img src="https://www.sameneenkoekopen.nl/uploads/images/recept/Eisbein-zelf-maken.jpg">
  <h3>Eisbein is a traditional German dish of juicy, tender pork knuckle with the crispiest, crackly skin.</h3>
  <p>Here I should include a paragraph or two describing the recipe.</p>
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>2 - 2.5 lbs Pork knuckle</li>
    <li>6 Garlic cloves</li>
    <li>2 tbsp Olive oil</li>
    <li>2 tbsp Vinegar</li>
    <li>2 tsp Salt (I prefer coarse sea salt)</li>
    <li>1 tsp Black pepper</li>
    <li>1 tsp Juniper berries</li>
    <li>1 tsp Caraway seeds</li>
    <li>1 tsp Fennel seeds</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Preperation</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Start by pricking the skin all over using a small pin. Do not pierce through the fat.  We're doing this for the skin to crisp, we don't want meat juices flowing through.</li>
    <li>Brush 1 tsp of the vinegar all over the flesh of the pork knuckle. Avoid getting vinegar on the skin or peeling the skin back.</li>
    <li>Make a small shallow incision in the pork flesh to insert each garlic clove.</li>
    <li>Cover pork skin with olive oil.  Then rub the seasoning of the salt, black pepper, juniper berries, caraway seeds, and fennel seeds all over the flesh and skin.</li>
    <li>Best you can, pull the skin down to stretch it.  When in place, use 2 metal scewars at the base (~1") and pierce through the pork knuckle in a 'X' fashion.  This will hold the skin stretched down which will ensure the skin is nice and crispy.</li>
    <li>If you are able place on a plate and put in the refridgerator over night to marinate.</li>
  </ol>
  <h3>Cooking Directions</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F</li>
    <li>You will need an oven safe pan that allows room or has the ability to accomedate a rack.  Place the pork knuckle on top of the rack.  If adding vegetables or sauerkraut, place them under the rack below the pork knuckle.</li>
    <li>Brush the remaining 1 tsp of vinegar on the skin.</li>
    <li>Leave in the oven for 30 minutes, turning half way through.</li>
    <li>Remove from oven and let rest for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
    <li>If you are able place on a plate and put in the refridgerator over night to marinate.</li>
  </ol>
