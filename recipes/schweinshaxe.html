      crispiest, crackly skin.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Eisbein is a perfectly juicy pork shank with a crisp and crackle of skin
      as you bite through. Pair with sauerkraut and you have the perfect dish.
      It is absolutely WUNDERBAR!
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 - 2.5lbs Pork shank (also referred to as Pork knuckle)</li>
      <li>6 Garlic cloves</li>
      <li>2 tbsp Olive oil</li>
      <li>2 tbsp Vinegar</li>
      <li>2 tsp Salt (I prefer coarse sea salt)</li>
      <li>1 tsp Black pepper</li>
      <li>1 tsp Juniper berries</li>
      <li>1 tsp Caraway seeds</li>
      <li>1 tsp Fennel seeds</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Preperation</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Start by pricking the skin all over using a small pin. Do not pierce
        through the fat. We're doing this for the skin to crisp, we don't want
        meat juices flowing through.
      </li>
      <li>
        Brush 1 tsp of the vinegar all over the flesh of the pork shank. Avoid
        getting vinegar on the skin or peeling the skin back.
      </li>
      <li>
        Make a small shallow incision in the pork flesh to insert each garlic
        clove.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover pork skin with olive oil. Then rub the seasoning of the salt,
        black pepper, juniper berries, caraway seeds, and fennel seeds all over
        the flesh and skin.
      </li>
      <li>
        Best you can, pull the skin down to stretch it. When in place, use 2
        metal scewars at the base (~1") and pierce through the pork shank in a
        'X' fashion. This will hold the skin stretched down which will ensure
        the skin is nice and crispy.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you are able place on a plate and put in the refridgerator over night
        to marinate.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Cooking Directions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F</li>
      <li>
        You will need an oven safe pan that allows room or has the ability to
        accomedate a rack. Place the pork shank on top of the rack. If adding
        vegetables or sauerkraut, place them under the rack below the pork
        shank.
      </li>
      <li>Brush the remaining 1 tsp of vinegar on the skin.</li>
      <li>Leave in the oven for 30 minutes, turning half way through.</li>
      <li>Remove from oven and let rest for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
