    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2.5 cups Unsweetened shredded coconut</li>
      <li>1/4 cup Pure maple syrup</li>
      <li>2 tbsp Melted coconut oil</li>
      <li>2 tsp Vanilla extract</li>
      <li>Handfull of raw almonds</li>
      <li>1 cup dark meltable chocolate chips</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Preperation</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Start by placing and blending the coconut, maple syrup, coconut oil, and
        vanilla extract in a food processor. This should take around 1 - 3
        minutes. You want to stop before the mixture turns into butter like
        consistancy. Better to be slightly "grainy".
      </li>
      <li>
        Using a spoon, scoop out 1 - 2 tablespoons and roll into a ball. Place
        on parchment paper and press down gently to flaten the ball out a little
        at the base while making a small thumb imprint on the top.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place 1 or 2 almonds within the top thumb print of each "half" ball.
      </li>
      <li>Place into freezer for 15 minutes.</li>
      <li>
        If you're adding chocolate, heat it slowly so that it is melted. Remove
        coconut almond bites from freezer. Next part is preference; either
        drizzle, stamp, or even dunk the hald balls into the chocolate.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once done coating chocolate, place back on parchment paper and let
        freeze for another 8-12 minutes.
      </li>
    </ol>
