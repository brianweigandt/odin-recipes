    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

      <li>2 tbsp Olive oil</li>
      <li>4 tbsp soy sauce</li>
      <li>Coarse sea salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Preperation</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Start by slicing the zucchini length wise cuts, not too thin. Place into
        ziplock bag with soy sauce and let marinate overnight if possible.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pat dry ribeye steaks. and then lightly coat all sides with 1 tbsp of
        olive oil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Apply coarse sea salt liberally all over. I use quite a bit of sea salt,
        but coat to your preference. Set on plate and let marinate overnight.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Cooking Directions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Let grill warm to medium-high heat.</li>
      <li>
        Place ribeye steaks down for about 12 minutes. Flipping once half way
        through. Change cooking times as needed dependent on how well you prefer
        your steak cooked. Try to only flip steak one time.
      </li>
      <li>
        Set the zucchini on the grill perpindicular to the grill grates for
        about 10 minutes. This will depend on how thin they were cut. Flip half
        way through.
      </li>
      <li>
        Let steaks rest for at least 3 minutes, preferably 5 minutes before
        cutting.
